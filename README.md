## Summary

This is a bot that runs in a Twitch.tv stream's chat, and allows viewers to add quotes to a database.

## Viewer Interaction

Viewers can add quotes with !addquote XX, view a specific quote with !quote XX, view a random quote with !quote, and delete a quote with !delquote XX.

## Code

This project is all written in Java, using Pircbot as base:
http://www.jibble.org/pircbot.php

Make sure to check out pircbot, it makes a lot of the silly Twitch interaction a whole lot easier.

You're going to need to have your own account setup to act as the Twitch bot, and figure out how to get an API key and whatnot for it.
Google should make all that fairly easy.

## Contact

Any and all questions should be directed to benjamin.w.massey@gmail.com - I'd love to talk about my silly little bot.

I also stream at https://www.twitch.tv/BeanSSBM and will use this bot sometimes - feel free to just hop in and ask questions, or send me a whisper.
